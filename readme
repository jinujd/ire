4)getStationDetails.php
    Returns the details of railway stations  from the station name or code.The station name or code should be passed as the get parameter named station_details.If exact station name/code is found,it returns the details for the station in the following format
	stationCode1~stationName1~divisionName1~zoneName1~stationCode2~stationName2~divisionName2~zoneName2~....
	If exact station name is not found ,it returns a list of similar stations.By default the number of stations in the list will be 5 
	Two additional get parameters start and limit are used to control the number of stations in the list.By default start = 0,limit =5
    List will contain stations from <start> th similar station to <limit> th similar station
5)stationCodes.php
    Stores the list of station codes as an array(<station name> => <station code>,<station name> => <station code>,...)	
6)stationNames.php	
    Stores the list of station codes as an array(<station code> => <station name>,<station code> => <station name>,...)	
7)updater.php
    Updates all station information,referring to files stationCodes.php,stationNames.php,and the website http://www.trainenquiry.com
    This ensure that local names of some stations are included.Some names that are not there in the website will be fetched from the two files and vice versa.Thus we get 
     almost a complete list of stations
     After running this file , a directory named stations will be created.In that directory there will be directories like stationsa,stationsb...Each of these directories store details of stations starting with the ending alphabet of the directory name	 
     Inside each of these directories,there will be two files.
     i)stFromName.php
	     This file stores the information about stations whose name starts with the ending alphabet of directory name ,as an array 
	     array(<station name> => array(<station code>,<division>,<zone>) ,....)
     ii)stFromCode.php
	     This file stores the information about stations whose station  code starts with the ending alphabet of directory name ,as an array 
             array(<station code> => array(<station name>,<division>,<zone>) ,....)
             Thus searching will be limited to any one of this directories and files instead of the entire list of stations,which enhances the speed of the application
